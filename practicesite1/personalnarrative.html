<h2>Career Goals</h2>
	<p>My ultimate career goal is to direct a localization program for a start-up tech company.</p>
	<p>I want to apply my education and industry experience to develop localization from the ground up. This includes defining coding standards for developers and setting expectations for customers for product localization maturity.</p>

<h2>Skills & Experience</h2>
	<p>I'm skilled at writing and editing, and I enjoy studying languages. I'm fluent in Russian, am proficient in Spanish, and an intermediate learner of German, French, and Chinese.</p>
	<p>I've taken classes in Java, C++ and .NET. I find programming languages fascinating and am eager to continue learning.</p>
	<p>In my personal life, I enjoy traveling and outdoor activities. I've visited over 25 countries and 25 states!</p>
